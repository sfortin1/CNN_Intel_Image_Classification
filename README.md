# CNN Pytorch - Intel Image Classification

## Description

### Description of Kaggle objectives

This notebook contains the code used for the Intel Image Classification dataset (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).

The following description is taken from the Kaggle website:
- *Context: This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world.*
- *Inspiration: Want to build powerful Neural network that can classify these images with more accuracy.*

### Description of Dataset

The following description of the dataset is taken from the Kaggle website:

*Content*
- *This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }*
- *The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.*
